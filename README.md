**My personal dotfiles.**

**Roadmap:**
- Need to clean up functions in bashrc
- Kill git aware prompt (bash-git-prompt)
- Update PS1 to show git branch name & unicode character while branch is dirty
- Add tutorial with screenshots for repo cloning, forking, integrating & customizing

**Feel free to fork!**
