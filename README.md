**My personal dotfiles.**

**Roadmap:**
- Clean up functions in bashrc
    - Switch function conditionals to case statements where appropriate
    - Perhaps move to separate file & source
    - Scratch function: shift/unshift/perhaps numbering instead of bullets?
- Add linter package to atom w/ bash & javascript linters
- Kill git aware prompt (bash-git-prompt)
- New function to show git branch name when in local repo & when dirty
- Add tutorial with screenshots for repo cloning, forking, integrating & customizing

**Feel free to fork!**
